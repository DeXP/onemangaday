You cannot do character with wings in Manga Maker Comipo with default capabilities. However, you can see demonic figure with wings in the manga "One Manga Day":

It is simple enough to make such character. You only need to put on the background layer... a crow!

By the way, the horns of a character - a simple flame from "Comic Mark". Flag "Draw Outside Panel" was enabled in my case:

In fact, the character does not actually have the wings: we just have a 2 layers one by one. Similarly, you can make angel-style character:

I used "Feathers_113" effect from "Comic Mark" tab.

Also, the wings can be imported as a 3D-object. For example, Fake Dragon Wings by MMDFakewings18 can be downloaded <a href=" http://mmdfakewings18.deviantart.com/art/Fake-Dragon-Wings-362489559" target="_blank">here</a>, you can read about importing to Comipo in [this tutorial](pmd-custom-hair.html). This is how character looks in Comipo:

Good luck, cruise!
