To create Android logo robot you need primitives from "3D Item" tab, "91. Primitive". In concrete, you need: column, sphere, box. Thats all, nothing more.

Let's start with the construction of the head of Android. To do this, take the field, stretch it to the whole 3D area, as in the picture:

<img src="{{ page.picdir }}start-sphere.png" alt="Start sphere in Comipo" class="imgshad">

Next, move the 3D sphere partially off displayed frame. To do this, take the mouse approximately where the green cross, and pull:

Put the color of the sphere by pressing the "Change Color"(C) in accordance with a picture:

Further add 2 more sphere and 2 cylinders on the head. They are our eyes and antennas, respectively. You can rotate with green-marked circles:

You have to put the antennas to the same color options as the head. Then upscrew by 100% eyes brightness slider ("Brightness"). We obtain:

![Comipo: head without shadows]({{ page.picdir }}head-no-shadow.png)

The head is ready, add a drop shadow. To do this, highlight the head and antennas, copy (Ctrl+C) and paste (Ctrl+V).

![Comipo: head of Android]({{ page.picdir }}select-shadow.png)

Put Inserted layers to the back layer (B, Shift + F4), do a little shift, mark as a color slightly darker green. If necessary, you can turn off the 3D Stroke (F9):

We obtain the final result:

Further drawing is not a problem, because only these techniques are used.

Good luck, and may the Android force be with you!
